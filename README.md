# Clustering-Solution-using-Python
The program asks the user to enter the file name from which data is to be read. It then asks the user to enter the attributes using which clustering is to be performed. It takes the number of clusters as input from user (which the user can identify by running the code which uses elbow method to find the best K value). It then assigns centroids at random, and clusters the data points to their nearest centroid based on the minimum Euclidean distance between that data point and the centroid.  The initial centroid locations are selected at random from the dataset, then after applying the clustering algorithm, the centroids are re-computed by taking the average of points in the cluster.
